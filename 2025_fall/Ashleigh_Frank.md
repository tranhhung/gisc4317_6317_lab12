### Self-Care Activity Tracker



The Self-Care Activity Tracker is a Python desktop application designed to help users maintain their daily self-care routines. The users can select a category from a list (Fitness, Creativity, Social and Self-care). They will receive a random suggested activity from the selected category and after completing the activity they will reflect on the activity and log their mood.
