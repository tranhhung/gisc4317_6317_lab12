Lahore is ranked as the most polluted city in the world and has been experiencing alarming increases in air pollution, land surface temperature, and heat vulnerability. Rapid urban expansion, declining vegetation, and shrinking public green spaces have intensified heat stress across the city. To solve this problem, Research and monitoring tools are urgently needed to understand how the loss of green cover is affecting Lahore’s urban environment and human well-being.
This project aims to develop a Python-based GIS tool that quantifies the relationship between vegetation density and urban heat patterns in Lahore. Using freely available Landsat satellite datasets, the tool will automatically extract Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) values for each administrative county of Lahore. The system will visualize spatial patterns, compute correlations between declining vegetation and increasing heat, and integrate socioeconomic and environmental indicators such as population density, building types, number of parks, and air quality index (AQI). The final product will help communities, planners, and policymakers identify which neighborhoods are environmentally healthier and which are more heat-vulnerable in 2025.
